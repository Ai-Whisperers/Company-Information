#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use ESLint configuration
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

```javascript
/**
 * Calculate the health score for a repository
 * @param {Object} metrics - Repository metrics
 * @returns {number} Health score (0-100)
 */
function calculateHealthScore(metrics) {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Add docstrings

```python
def calculate_health_score(metrics: dict) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the health score for a repository.

    Args:
        metrics: Repository metrics dictionary

    Returns:
        Health score between 0 and 100
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Documentation Style

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Include code examples
- Keep language clear and concise
- Update README when adding features
