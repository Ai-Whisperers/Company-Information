## Implementation Guidelines

### For Test Implementation
1. Start with unit tests (ConfigHelpers, LoggingFunctions)
2. Use existing test structure in files
3. Aim for minimum 60% coverage initially
4. Focus on critical path testing first

### For PR Reviews
1. Group similar PRs (e.g., all dependency updates)
2. Test in staging before merging to main
3. Use batch merge for non-breaking updates
4. Document any breaking changes

### For Security Updates
1. Use Azure Key Vault or GitHub Secrets for PAT storage
2. Implement 90-day rotation policy
3. Add pre-commit hooks for secret scanning
4. Use least-privilege principle for all tokens

### For Script Updates
1. Create config file for all hardcoded values
2. Use environment variables where appropriate
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Add verbose logging for debugging

## Success Metrics

- **Week 1**: All tests implemented, 20 PRs processed
- **Week 2**: Security measures in place, paths configurable
- **Month 1**: 60% test coverage, all documentation updated
- **Quarter 1**: Full monitoring suite, 80% test coverage

## Notes

- Prioritize based on risk and impact
- Group related tasks for efficiency
- Test all changes in development first
- Document as you implement
- Regular commits with clear messages
