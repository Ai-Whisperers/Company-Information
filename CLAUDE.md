This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Organization Overview

AI-Whisperers is a multi-repository organization focused on developing innovative AI solutions and integrations. The organization follows a structured approach with separate repositories for different concerns.

## Repository Structure

This is the **Company-Information** repository which serves as the central hub for:
- Organization-wide documentation and strategy
- GitHub Actions for cross-repository management
- Azure DevOps integration and work items
- Business setup and planning documents

The organization maintains these actual code repositories:
- **[Comment-Analizer](https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/Comment-Analizer)**: AI-powered customer feedback analysis (Python, GPT-4, Streamlit)
- **[AI-Investment](https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/AI-Investment)**: Waardhaven AutoIndex investment platform (FastAPI, Next.js, 145+ endpoints)
- **[clockify-ADO-automated-report](https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/clockify-ADO-automated-report)**: Time tracking automation (Python, Hexagonal Architecture)
- **[AI-Whisperers-website-and-courses](https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/AI-Whisperers-website-and-courses)**: Strategic educational platform (Planning)
- **[WPG-Amenities](https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/WPG-Amenities)**: Winnipeg local services (Assessment required)
- **[AI-Whisperers-Website](https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/AI-Whisperers-Website)**: Legacy website (Migration planned)
- **[AI-Whisperers](https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/AI-Whisperers)**: Organizational standards (Development required)
- **[Call-Recorder](https://github.com/Ai-Whisperers/Call-Recorder)**: Inactive repository (Archive recommended)

**Note**: Each repository is maintained independently. Clone only the repositories you need for your current work.

## Development Commands

**Important**: These commands should be run in their respective repository directories after cloning them separately.

## Organizational Management Tools

This repository includes PowerShell-based management tools for cross-repository coordination:

### Management Scripts

Located in the `scripts/` directory:

```powershell
# Management Overview
.\management-summary.ps1             # Overview of all management tools and system status

# Todo Management
.\todo-manager.ps1 status           # View todos across all repositories  
.\todo-manager.ps1 sync             # Synchronize todo changes across repos

# Repository Monitoring  
.\repo-monitor-dashboard.ps1        # Repository health and activity dashboard
.\repo-monitor-dashboard.ps1 health # Focus on repositories needing attention
.\repo-monitor-dashboard.ps1 activity # Activity summary across organization

# File Synchronization
.\file-sync-manager.ps1 status      # Check file synchronization status
.\file-sync-manager.ps1 validate    # Validate template files before sync

# Azure DevOps Integration
.\azure-devops-sync.ps1 status      # Check Azure DevOps integration status
.\azure-devops-sync.ps1 test        # Test prerequisites and connectivity
```

### Prerequisites for Management Tools

- **GitHub CLI**: Required for repository access and API operations
  ```bash
  # Install: https://cli.github.com/
  gh auth login  # Authenticate with GitHub
  ```
  
- **Azure CLI** (for DevOps integration): Required for Azure DevOps sync features
  ```bash
  # Install: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
  az login  # Authenticate with Azure
  az extension add --name azure-devops  # Install DevOps extension
  ```

- **PowerShell**: Scripts tested with PowerShell 5.1+ on Windows

### Management Features

- **Cross-Repository Todo Tracking**: Automatically discovers and tracks todo items across all organization repositories
- **Repository Health Monitoring**: Tracks commit activity, open issues, and pull requests with health scoring
- **Documentation Template Sync**: Maintains consistent documentation standards across repositories
- **Azure DevOps Integration**: Framework for synchronizing GitHub issues and PRs with Azure work items
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Single interface for monitoring organizational health and progress

### Configuration

Management tools are configured for the AI-Whisperers organization. Key configuration files:
- Repository lists are dynamically fetched from GitHub API
- Template files located in `documentation-templates/` directory
- Todo files located in `project-todos/` directory  
- Azure DevOps settings configurable in scripts (organization/project names)

## Deployment Considerations

- All services use Docker with multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes deployments with resource limits and health checks
- ML models require GPU resources for training/inference
- Frontend deploys to CDN with API proxy configuration
